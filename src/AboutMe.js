      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My life is a complex algorithm of data analysis, gaming victories, and the endless search for the perfect anime. Most of my predictive skills, however, go toward guessing which of my two cats will demand dinner first 🐱.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a passionate advocate for <strong>women in tech</strong> and love applying my skills in <strong>data science</strong> to real-world problems. Beyond coding, I explore new <strong>gaming</strong> adventures, lose myself in <strong>anime</strong>, and dedicate time to giving back, whether through mentoring the <strong>younger generation</strong> or volunteering at a local cat rescue 🐾.
      </p>
      <p>
        At home, my two <strong>cats</strong> are not just my companions but also my inspiration, reminding me that technology should be both functional and personal. And when I’m not analyzing data, you might find me capturing moments for my growing <strong>photography portfolio</strong>, which you can view in the shining box 📸.
