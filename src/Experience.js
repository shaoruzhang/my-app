          At New York Life, I‚Äôve been diving into the world of large language models,
          engineering evaluation metrics for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
          pipeline. It‚Äôs been exciting to give the Service team a way to measure and
          improve generative AI outputs for customer-facing use cases. Alongside this,
          I built an interactive model drift dashboard with Streamlit and Python, making
          it easier to spot when cross-sell and underwriting models start to wander off
          course, with the goal of reducing drift incidents by 5%.

          During my rotational program, I wore many hats as a data scientist. One of my
          favorite projects was building XGBoost and Isolation Forest models that boosted
          fraud detection by 12%, ultimately saving $200K across multiple products.
          Another highlight was analyzing an A/B test for the NYL website‚Äôs interest form,
          which revealed the winning variant and drove a 6% increase in user engagement.
          I also ventured into NLP, using TF-IDF and LDA to analyze client voice recordings.
          This work helped reduce average call time by 15%. And because I can‚Äôt resist
          finding efficiencies, I automated much of our data preparation pipeline in R,
          which improved team productivity by 25%.

          As a Data Science Fellow, I tackled a COVID-19 project that combined data wrangling
          in Python on Google Colab with storytelling through Tableau. The goal was to
          uncover and visualize patterns in COVID-19 cases across NYC schools, helping to
          make sense of a constantly shifting situation.

          My time as a Wintern at JPMorgan Chase introduced me to the fast-paced world of
          software engineering. I streamlined the data collection phase for a trading widget
          by integrating API calls and web scraping, while also setting up rigorous unit
          tests to ensure everything ran smoothly and reliably.

          At Snap, I balanced creative research with analytical rigor. I conducted qualitative
          research on about 30 marketing articles, presenting insights to leadership as they
          navigated the shift away from third-party cookies. On the quantitative side, I
          evaluated more than 700 ads and 52 campaigns across 13 metrics, helping teams
          understand what really drove brand lift and ad effectiveness.
